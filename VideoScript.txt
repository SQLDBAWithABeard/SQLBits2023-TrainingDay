Rob: Are you a DBA, senior or junior, looking after 1 or 100,000 instances, a developer who interacts with SQL Server, an accidental DBA or you have DevOps in your job title.

Jess: Are you interested in improving your PowerShell skills for SQL Server or reducing the time you and your team spend administering SQL Server.


We have both worked with many large estates and at that scale automation is vital to keeping on top of things.

The plan for the training day, is to split it in half and cover two important areas - this is basically two training days in one!

Firstly, we will increase your PowerShell and dbatools automation knowledge by a substantial number of points and dive deep into solving some more challenging estate automation tasks such as

    Updating and patching your SQL Instances with minimal downtime
    Adding replicas to Availability Groups without effort
    Advanced migrations for large mission critical databases
    Integrating database process automation with CI/CD tooling such as GitHub Actions
    And wherever else the adventure takes us
    You will learn from two experts, how we have solved the challenges of automating estates at scale and in a performant way.

Then we will level you up with estate validation so that you can be sure everything is in order, and you can easily demonstrate that every instance is in a particular state to any dwarven cleric or provide validation to the elven auditors that your instances pass the CIS SQL security benchmark using dbachecks for example.

What should our friends bring Rob?
All you need is yourself! Something to take notes, and a laptop would be a bonus so you can follow along with all our examples
