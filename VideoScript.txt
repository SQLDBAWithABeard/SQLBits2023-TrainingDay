Jess:  HEY - Can you answer yes to any of these questions?

Rob: Are you a DBA? either senior or junior ?

Jess:  Are you looking after 1 or 100,000 instances? 

Rob: Are you a developer who interacts with SQL Server? 

Jess: or an accidental DBA? 

Rob: or do you have DevOps in your job title?

Jess: Are you interested in improving your PowerShell skills for SQL Server? 

Rob:  or reducing the time you and your team spend administering it?

Jess: We have much experience working with large estates. We know that at scale, automation is vital to keeping on top of things. We will share all that we know

Rob (That we can fit in in a day!!)

Jess: in our Training Day. The plan is to split it in half and cover two important areas - 

Rob: Hey you mean its basically two training days in one?

Jess: Yes. First, we will increase your PowerShell and dbatools automation knowledge and dive deep into solving some of the more challenging estate automation tasks such as

Rob:    Updating and patching your SQL Instances with minimal downtime
Jess:   Adding replicas to Availability Groups without effort
Rob:    Large mission critical database migrations
Jess:    CI/CD automation for database processes with GitHub Actions
Rob:     And wherever else the adventure takes us

Rob Then we will level you up with estate validation so that you can be sure everything is in order
Jess: Thats Training day part 2 right?

Rob: Uh Huh, and that you can easily demonstrate that every instance is in the particular state to any dwarven cleric 

Jess: or provide validation to the elvish auditors that your instances pass the CIS SQL security benchmark using dbachecks.
What should our friends bring Rob?
Rob: All you need is yourself! Something to take notes, and a laptop would be a bonus so you can follow along with all our examples

Jess: We look forward to seeing you in Wales. If you have questions get in touch.
